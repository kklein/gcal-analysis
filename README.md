# gcal-analysis

This script plots information about sports activities based on google calendar entries. In particular, it visualizes
  - entries with a certain color coding and counts how many of those exist per
  week
  - entries with a certain description and adds up the distances [km] contained
  in their respective comments per week

Follow [google's calendar quickstart in python](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python)
